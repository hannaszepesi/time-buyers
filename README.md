# TimeBuyers

This web application is dedicated for people who would like to buy someone else's time of selling theirs by completing certain tasks. It would be also possible to exchange them. This is the final team project of my journey in Codecool. The development lasted until six weeks and I mainly contributed to the design, some features, and handling of the security part on the frontend. On the backend, I also took some part in the security and integration of the JPA.
